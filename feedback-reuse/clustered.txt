 Excellent,
 Can you be more insightful/go into more depth?,
 Too caption-heavy, try making better use of speech bubbles!,
 Somewhat text-heavy.,
 Avoid using a pen completely!,
 These arent different solutions.,
 Too many words. These solutions are not divergent enough, its the same basic premise underneath.,
 Being generous here. # is not detailed enough.,
  doesnt seem feasible/practical,
 I really like the idea in the  panel in #.,
 Plus 1 for the  joke on storyline  :D,
 Reduce the focus on how the interface would be, otherwise crisp :),
  is detailed but focuses on the wrong things,
 Sounds great!,
 Please select only the relevant pages next time (thanks)!,
 No real solution here,
 Too unclear,
 Looks great (note that such level of detail is not necessary)!,
 Is the target audience only those who are interested in ?,
 Panel  to  is non sequitur,
 The main page states  but the only function it shows in the prototype is ,
 The prototype doesnt show how users can achieve  as described in storyboard #,
 This is too simplistic an idea to pursue for a long enough project as this. Well executed, though!,
 Making a Chrome extension is unchartered territory for this course which comes with its own set of risks.,
 This has very little functionality, and isnt really a paper prototype,
 Nice,
 not for mobile form factor, no functionality,
 Its missing a science/data component and is missing too much detail,
 Some aspects of the interaction missing such as .,
 Is it just a ? Are there other pages or tabs to navigate to?,
 Not all parts of the interface are clear.,
 Well presented!,
 Of the limited interaction, seems accessible for development,
 Missing details,
 Your point of view wasnt clear, though the prototype does connect with the storyboard..,
 the fidelity could be better,
 Interesting idea, but why would people care about ? Whats the reward?,
 Wheres the science?,
 Nicely done! Reduce the clutter a bit and this can be a great way to ,
 Limited functionality,
 This prototype doesnt really stand on its own as a .,
 Wheres the science?,
 The prototype seems incomplete and appears to lack important pages/interactions.,
 not enough details,
 Same comment as for prototype #1.,
 Missing too much detail,
 I really like this one. Great job!,
 I understand the point, but how does this differ from sites like ?,
 Lack of detail fails to connect it to anything,
 quite questionable, but Ill give you the point,


Cluster 1 words: good, ideas,

Cluster 1 comments:
 Good, this is less taboo due to multifaceted point of view. Still, try to move more toward unexplored domains.,
 Try to keep details to a minimum. Storyboards are not meant to be elaborately illustrated. Good drawing, though :),
  doesnt address the POV.  is good.,
 Good ideas, but there could be many alternatives that already exist: try to think how your offering is novel.,
 Good work!,
  is too broadly phrased to give a good idea what the app assists in doing.,
 Good job. It would be good to see the interaction regarding what happens after .,
 Good job on the functionality that is present, but again, could benefit from fleshing out more.,
 1 for the good design :),
 Good level of detail,
 Good job!,


Cluster 2 words: app, focused,

Cluster 2 comments:
 Doesnt really show how the app solves the problems,
 Storyboard # needs to have a little more detail about how the user interacts with the app...,
 They are very, very similar. Ill give you the point though since the app itself is differing with each storyboard,
 This storyboard has a little too much focus on the specific features of the app and the interface.,
 How the app actually helps fulfill the need is ambiguous (that should be addressed). Nicely explained situation, though.,
 Overall, its a bit ambiguous and focuses on features of the app.,
 The leap from using the app to  is unclear.,
 Some of the functionality is unclear. What else can the app do besides have the user input ?,
 I dont see enough detail. You havent explored all the options that your app provides on the home screen..,
 very cluttered, it would be hard to make a functional app from this,


Cluster 3 words: needs, users,

Cluster 3 comments:
 We want to look for needs rather than solutions (i.e. "visualizing histories"),
 POV needs to state the core problem,
 Youve taken an interesting stance, but it needs direction.,
 The user need could be deeper/identified better,
 I love the analogy here, but the need and satisfaction are a bit unclear,
 Try establishing the need more clearly.,
 There is no need satisfaction at the end of your board.,
 User need not too well-demonstrated,
 needs more fidelity,


Cluster 4 words: pov, storyboards,

Cluster 4 comments:
 Relatively more detailed, more relatable POV,
 Okay POV, but I think the  has more spotlight than the actual users of it!,
 I like this POV,
 POV could probably be expanded on a bit more with why people arent motivated enough to .,
 OK POV, but this is now taboo. Consider a multifaceted approach or a new topic altogether.,
 POV is too generic,
 The first two storyboards kinda approach the POV the same way.,
 The storyboards dont really touch upon the  concept you mentioned in your POV.,
 Because the POV is incorrect, the storyboards are not engaging with the POV correctly.,
 This storyboard doesnt address the  aspect of your POV,
 I dont really see how this is connected to the specific POV. Point given for connecting with a storyboard,
 Because the POV was incorrect.,
 This doesnt connect to your POV or a particular storyboard.,


Cluster 5 words: storyboards, really,

Cluster 5 comments:
 These storyboards assume that  is inherently competitive, but is it really? Why would  motivate someone more?,
 The storyboards arent really focused on , more so just the  component.,
 The  storyboard is the only one that really shows the  component of your ideas.,
 The first storyboard should have used a thicker instrument -- its just not the same with a pen.,
 Great storyboards, but taboo/uninspired solutions.,
 Tip: having panels would provide some structure to the storyboard.,
 Storyboards are too focused on the dialogue which draws away from the high level design.,
 It would be difficult to develop a prototype from these storyboards alone.,
 No detail to develop from in these storyboards,
 Generous here because the storyboards arent very divergent,
 There is a fair bit of repetition in the elements portrayed in the storyboards.,
 Missed the point of using a storyboard,
 The storyboard does not state a problem of a user.,

Top terms per cluster:

Cluster 0 words: users, exactly,

Cluster 0 comments:
 The  component is not clear from this video prototype, but  the other components clear, so point awarded.,
 Its unclear from the video what exactly the purpose of the app is.,
 Not clear exactly who your target users are.,
 Would have liked to see more features of the  aspect and what the user could do with that,


Cluster 1 words: features, app,

Cluster 1 comments:
 Theres no real demonstration of the features on the app.,
 The main features were captured, but the full interactions of the app arent too clear in the video.,
 Would have been nice to see more of the navigational interactions in the app, but the main features were covered.,


Cluster 2 words: commentary, use,

Cluster 2 comments:
 You might further want to conduct comparative analysis on existing  apps.,
 You could use different voices so that there is a commentary as well!,
 A commentary while the app was being used would have gone a long way.,


Cluster 3 words: substantial, idea,

Cluster 3 comments:
 Good work with the new prototype - its fairly substantial now.,
 Its substantial but too familiar (in terms of idea).,
 Great creativity in this idea! Think about how to make it more competitive or unique from other apps. ,


Cluster 4 words: nicely, thorough,

Cluster 4 comments:
 Nicely done. ,
 Nice video, and thorough evaluation!,
