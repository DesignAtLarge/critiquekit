Cluster 0 words: _blank_, storyboards,

Cluster 0 comments: Okay POV, but I think the _blank_ has more spotlight than the actual users of it!,
 POV could probably be expanded on a bit more with why people aren't motivated enough to _blank_.,
 Being generous here. #_blank_ is not detailed enough.,
 _blank_ doesn't seem feasible/practical,
 I really like the idea in the _blank_ panel in #_blank_.,
 _blank_ doesn't address the POV. _blank_ is good.,
 Plus 1 for the _blank_ joke on storyline _blank_ :D,
 _blank_ is detailed but focuses on the wrong things,
 _blank_ is too broadly phrased to give a good idea what the app assists in doing.,
 Is the target audience only those who are interested in _blank_?,
 The leap from using the app to _blank_ is unclear.,
 Panel _blank_ to _blank_ is non sequitur,
 Good job. It would be good to see the interaction regarding what happens after _blank_.,
 The main page states _blank_ but the only function it shows in the prototype is _blank_,
 Some aspects of the interaction missing such as _blank_.,
 Some of the functionality is unclear. What else can the app do besides have the user input _blank_?,
 Is it just a _blank_? Are there other pages or tabs to navigate to?,
 Interesting idea, but why would people care about _blank_? What's the reward?,
 Nicely done! Reduce the clutter a bit and this can be a great way to _blank_,
 This prototype doesn't really stand on its own as a _blank_.,
 I understand the point, but how does this differ from sites like _blank_?,


Cluster 1 words: storyboards, _blank_,

Cluster 1 comments: Relatively more detailed, more relatable POV,
 We want to look for needs rather than solutions (i.e. "visualizing histories"),
 POV needs to state the core problem,
 I like this POV,
 You've taken an interesting stance, but it needs direction.,
 Good, this is less taboo due to multifaceted point of view. Still, try to move more toward unexplored domains.,
 OK POV, but this is now taboo. Consider a multifaceted approach or a new topic altogether.,
 Excellent,
 Can you be more insightful/go into more depth?,
 The user need could be deeper/identified better,
 POV is too generic,
 Too caption-heavy, try making better use of speech bubbles!,
 Somewhat text-heavy.,
 Avoid using a pen completely!,
 Doesn't really show how the app solves the problems,
 These aren't different solutions.,
 Too many words. These solutions are not divergent enough, it's the same basic premise underneath.,
 Good ideas, but there could be many alternatives that already exist: try to think how your offering is novel.,
 Reduce the focus on how the interface would be, otherwise crisp :),
 I love the analogy here, but the need and satisfaction are a bit unclear,
 Good work!,
 Sounds great!,
 Try establishing the need more clearly.,
 Please select only the relevant pages next time (thanks)!,
 How the app actually helps fulfill the need is ambiguous (that should be addressed). Nicely explained situation, though.,
 No real solution here,
 Too unclear,
 There is no need satisfaction at the end of your board.,
 User need not too well-demonstrated,
 Overall, it's a bit ambiguous and focuses on features of the app.,
 Looks great (note that such level of detail is not necessary)!,
 This is too simplistic an idea to pursue for a long enough project as this. Well executed, though!,
 Making a Chrome extension is unchartered territory for this course which comes with its own set of risks.,
 This has very little functionality, and isn't really a paper prototype,
 Nice,
 not for mobile form factor, no functionality,
 It's missing a science/data component and is missing too much detail,
 Not all parts of the interface are clear.,
 Well presented!,
 Of the limited interaction, seems accessible for development,
 Missing details,
 Good job on the functionality that is present, but again, could benefit from fleshing out more.,
 I don't see enough detail. You haven't explored all the options that your app provides on the home screen..,
 Your point of view wasn't clear, though the prototype does connect with the storyboard..,
 the fidelity could be better,
 very cluttered, it would be hard to make a functional app from this,
 1 for the good design :),
 Where's the science?,
 Because the POV was incorrect.,
 Limited functionality,
 Where's the science?,
 The prototype seems incomplete and appears to lack important pages/interactions.,
 not enough details,
 Same comment as for prototype #1.,
 Missing too much detail,
 Good level of detail,
 I really like this one. Great job!,
 needs more fidelity,
 Good job!,
 Lack of detail fails to connect it to anything,
 quite questionable, but I'll give you the point,


Cluster 2 words: storyboards, _blank_,

Cluster 2 comments: The first two storyboards kinda approach the POV the same way.,
 Try to keep details to a minimum. Storyboards are not meant to be elaborately illustrated. Good drawing, though :),
 The first storyboard should have used a thicker instrument -- it's just not the same with a pen.,
 Great storyboards, but taboo/uninspired solutions.,
 Because the POV is incorrect, the storyboards are not engaging with the POV correctly.,
 They are very, very similar. I'll give you the point though since the app itself is differing with each storyboard,
 Tip: having panels would provide some structure to the storyboard.,
 Storyboards are too focused on the dialogue which draws away from the high level design.,
 It would be difficult to develop a prototype from these storyboards alone.,
 No detail to develop from in these storyboards,
 Generous here because the storyboards aren't very divergent,
 This storyboard has a little too much focus on the specific features of the app and the interface.,
 There is a fair bit of repetition in the elements portrayed in the storyboards.,
 Missed the point of using a storyboard,
 The storyboard does not state a problem of a user.,
 I don't really see how this is connected to the specific POV. Point given for connecting with a storyboard,
 This doesn't connect to your POV or a particular storyboard.,


Cluster 3 words: _blank_, storyboards,

Cluster 3 comments: These storyboards assume that _blank_ is inherently competitive, but is it really? Why would _blank_ motivate someone more?,
 The storyboards aren't really focused on _blank_, more so just the _blank_ component.,
 The _blank_ storyboard is the only one that really shows the _blank_ component of your ideas.,
 The prototype doesn't show how users can achieve _blank_ as described in storyboard #_blank_,


Cluster 4 words: storyboards, _blank_,

Cluster 4 comments: The storyboards don't really touch upon the _blank_ concept you mentioned in your POV.,
 Storyboard #_blank_ needs to have a little more detail about how the user interacts with the app...,
 This storyboard doesn't address the _blank_ aspect of your POV,
