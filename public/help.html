			<p>You can use this website to provide feedback on your peers' work, and to see the feedback other

			<p>Some tips: Good feedback is...</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Specific</b>. E.g., instead of <i>"looks great!"</i>... 
					try, <i>"I like the layout of this section, it is simple and 
					makes it easy to find what I need."</i></li>
				<li><b>Actionable</b>. E.g., instead of <i>"This header is boring,

					Try adding a gradient to the background and making the text 
					bolder so it stands out."</i></li>
