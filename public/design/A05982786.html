<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>Lead User: Ryan is a professional comic book and video game artist who primarily uses his Wacom tablet and multiple monitors to get his work done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Ryan is on a tight deadline working on a Marvel comic. He uses his Wacom tablet to create his artwork. He also has Photoshop, scripts from the studio, image references from the studio, and videos up on his monitors. He prefers having all his windows up at once unobstructed. He is also tired of constantly looking up and down from his Wacom tablet to the monitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video shows a modular tablet that clicks into each other seamlessly. Ryan can move around different windows anywhere on the tablet screens. He can also click in his Wacom tablet so it becomes part of the large screen tablet.&nbsp;</p></span>
