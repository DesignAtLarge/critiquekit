Persona: Katie is a soon-to-be bride who wants the perfect flowers for her wedding,

Inch + Task: Katie is in a rush while doing errands for her wedding. While on the bus on the way to the dress store, she suddenly forgets what flowers she had originally wanted. She only knows some basic details and that her fiancee had given them to her on their first date.

In this interface, Katie can use an app on her smart watch to say out loud the characteristics of the flower she's looking for. The app will take in her input and then provide a list of flowers that match her description, which she can swipe through, and press on for more info. She can also favorite a flower by holding her finger on its image and access the favorites at any time.

Foot + Task: Katie wants to look at flowers and see how they look like in different arrangements, as well as what they would look like when placed in the ceremony.

In this interface, Katie can select flowers by specifying their description, and in another screen can merge them into bouquets, hedges, and other such arrangements. In a separate section within the merging screen, Katie can upload an image of what the ceremony space might look like and place the flower combinations there to see if they match.

Yard + Task: Katie wants to look through lots of different flowers with the help of her bridesmaids. They all want to collect different flowers they like and then compare them as they go.

In this interface, Katie and her bridesmaids can select parameters for the types of flowers that appear and then collect them in little baskets by dragging the flowers into them. They can also merge the flowers into different arrangements, and move the flowers and baskets across the different sections of the screen to compare and contrast. This allows them to easily collaborate on what flowers would work best for the wedding.
