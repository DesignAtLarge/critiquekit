<p>Lead User: Nicolle Woo, she developed a system for helping her to keep track of the food that she has in the fridge. When she buys groceries, she attaches the receipt to the door of the fridge and highlights certain items she may not buy often and would likely to forget about, or just items that go bad quickly and need to be consumed right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task: Nicolle doesn't want the food she buys to go bad in the fridge as a result of being&nbsp;forgotten about or because she didn't realize it was close to expiring before it was too late. However, she doesn't want to put any effort into keeping track or worrying about these problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interface is attached to the fridge and also accessible&nbsp;from the users smartphone. This view allows the user to see a list of items they have in their fridge sorted by how quickly they will expire. Each item is added automatically from a grocery store receipt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She plans on eating the two pre-made meals that are about to expire for lunch and dinner tomorrow because she knows it will be a busy day for her and she won't have time to cook. For tonight, however, she wants to make something tasty and so sorts her food by category to get a general sense of what she has in the fridge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After she makes dinner, she has some leftovers she is going to save for later. She chooses to add an item, snaps a quick picture, enters a name and chooses the date it will expire before saving it to her fridge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She feels like she has not been eating the most healthy lately and so decides to see what items she purchases most frequently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, at any point, she can swipe right to delete an item from her list.</p>
