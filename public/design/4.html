<p><strong>Lead User:</strong> Nicolle Woo, she developed a system for helping her to keep track of the food that she has in the fridge. When she buys groceries, she attaches the receipt to the door of the fridge and highlights certain items she may not buy often and would likely to forget about, or just items that go bad quickly and need to be consumed right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Nicolle doesn't want the food she buys to go bad in the fridge as a result of being&nbsp;forgotten about or because she didn't realize it was close to expiring before it was too late. However, she doesn't want to put any effort into keeping track or worrying about these problems. She also needs a way to add items that were purchased with cash and as a result are not added to her smart fridge automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Common:</strong> Goes to grocery store and all of the items they purchase are added to the smart fridge automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uncommon:</strong> Buys an item with cash which cannot be automatically added to the smart fridge.</p>
