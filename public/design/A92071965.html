He always publish some educational YouTube tutorial videos on the topic of Calculus and Computer Science. However, he cannot afford the price of a digital tablet or a digital backboard.<br> <br><strong>Scenario:</strong> Daniel is teaching “pumping lemma”, a basic concept in the field of computing theory. In this tutorial video, he wants to include some formal definitions and different level of examples. He want to sketch some formula and graphs when he is teaching the concept and explaining the examples. He has tried different tools to achieve this goal such as Microsoft Powerpoint, Google Slides. However, these current solutions don’t support sketching and recording. Usually, Daniel will use a cellphone camera to record a first person view video on his desk when he is sketching. However, these videos are usually has poor quality and hard to watch for students.&nbsp;</p>
