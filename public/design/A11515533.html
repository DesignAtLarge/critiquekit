<p>I use vim on a regular basis and I know there are a lot of shortcuts that could speed up small interactions I have with vim but I am typically too lazy to look up new commands to try out (I also get distracted very easily). I do not like having to stop what I am working on to look up new commands because it is inconvenient and distracts from the work I am trying to complete (especially when it turns out they do not exist).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:&nbsp;</strong>My new add-on to vim tracks what I do in vim and knows where I could use shortcuts to make things faster. In this example I use dd to delete a block of text line by line when I could be entering visual mode, selecting a block of text and then deleting it at once. This interface suggests the change in real time so I can learn about the new command in vim instead of having to stop what I am doing and look it up to see if a better command exists. It also allows me to see how much time I have saved using new commands and how many new commands I have learned. It is a very simple add on to vim so it will not distract from what I am working on and can also be hidden if I do not want to see the new commands.</p>
