<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> When I really get fed up with a simple task in vim or just terminal I will finally look up a command for it and if there isn’t one I usually deal with the few extra steps it takes instead of creating my own shortcut. On the occasions I do find a command in vim or terminal it usually becomes my new favorite thing to use. While everyone in CS learns a tiny bit in 15L, very few people continue to use the commands. One of my friends creates new shell scripts whenever a command doesn’t exist that he wants to use. This helps him learn more, while also significantly freeing up time once the new command is created. The idea of creating new commands in terminal, and just giving more people easy access to finding out what commands are available and why they are useful inspired my design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> using vim and terminal on a regular basis and wanting to learn more commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> My design is simply a vim add on. Every time the user enters vim a new command will show up on the bottom line for them to try out. This command was chosen specifically for them. Vim (the add on) keeps track of the regularly used commands by the user, as well as areas where using a vim command would save the user time. If the user begins using the suggested command, the command will not be suggested again and a new one will be. If the user stops using it and the interface notices the user losing time from not using the command, it will suggest the command again.&nbsp; The users average time completing activities such as deleting a block of text is recorded and statistics can be seen for how much using a new command has improved the users time efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another feature is that every week the user will be prompted to say one thing about vim or terminal that they wish they could change or improve. If it is possible, suggested links will pop up to show the user how to complete the task. (This is because many times only a simple line needs to be added to a .vimrc file or a simple shell command).</p>
