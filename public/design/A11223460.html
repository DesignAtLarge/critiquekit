<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>My task is a UCSD ride share service. Sometimes people driving drive right by bus stops full of people who are usually mostly ucsd students heading towards campus. What most people in the group said stopped them from picking people up (or would stop someone waiting at a bus stop from getting in the car) was the safety/ accountability that are offered from a service that would help coordinate, think uber and lyft. In my ride share prototype the user must sign up with a .edu email. They can choose to drive or ride. If a user does both then they can use tokens to pay for the rides (every time you drive you earn a ride) but if the user only does one they can choose to pay (or get paid as the driver). If this idea got big enough there may be carpool spots at UCSD for those who use the program to get easier parking.&nbsp;</p>
