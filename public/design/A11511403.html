<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hans Yuan’s 2006 Altima is starting to show signs of decay with a few buttons, fuses, and switches. The issues are minor, and for example are on the level of “The window doesn’t go down anymore unless I press the button multiple times” or “the gear shift mechanism that unlocks the gears doesn’t work anymore”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the video, I am trying to use the UI to find the issue I’m having. The issue I am having pertains to a specific car, the model, and the year. However, the issue is not a common issue — it is an obscure but obstructive issue for which I need a fast get-around.&nbsp; Later on, I myself might be able to provide answers or explanations about the issue.</p>

<p>There are a couple of forums on the internet that allow people to post about these small, but important issues. Whereas the issues might feel random, many people likely have dealt with the issue in some form. However, because of the unorganized nature of forum communication, many of the posts repeat the same problem (likely because it is the most common) which buries slightly less common issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lead users are us, the people who run into these specific issues with cars from previous decades, where the solution might be a simple but unofficial and undocumented fix, (or me, someone who uses these forums to try and find out information about how to fix the issue.) The UI’s inspiration comes from the form format, but is specifically used to organize car issues and fixes. Currently, the solution to the design is to Google it and scan multiple forum pages for the solution. Piazza is a closer solution, but is still more of a Q&amp;A type of space.&nbsp;</p>
