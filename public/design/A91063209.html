Addiction can blind a person's judgment, and it would be nice to have some indication that can tell me when I should go to sleep. My prototype can do that! By putting in user's next day schedule, the interface determines when users should rest based on the work hours and the workloads they have for tomorrow. It also analyzes how well the users have been sleeping for the past nights. If it sees a real and constant pattern, it will tell the users to "keep it up," otherwise it will say that they should sleep early. A watch interface can monitor their sleeping schedule and automatically updates them.When the users are playing a game, and it is soon to be the designated time. There will be a pop up on their screen telling them that they should end their game fast and sleep soon. When it hits the designated time, another pop-up will tell them that they should "go to bed." There will be no cancel button, just snooze, forcing users to listen to the instructions. Users can customize the pop-up's snooze as well as the screen's brightness and many other features. There's also an optional option that users can choose to have the computer shut down if the users hit the snooze button for a certain amount of time. (can be customized as well.) The watch interface will monitor your heartbeat, breathing pattern and body heat. Users can activate Spotify deep sleep playlist on there which it will play sleepy songs that can help users sleep.&nbsp;</p>
