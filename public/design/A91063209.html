<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:&nbsp;</strong>Gary is having hard time balancing between his school and his work, he uses the interface to find out when should he go to sleep. First he puts in his schedules for tomorrow, he puts down the time it start and finish. Then he determines which activities are considered stressful and which are not. Then after he finishes, he moves on to the graph to see how many hours of sleep he's been getting&nbsp;for the past days. Based on the number of sleeps and his schedule for tomorrow, the interface calculates a time for him to sleep. (In the video, it says 12:00am.) Gary then continues playing his game until 11:50pm, when a pop up appeared and tells him he only have 10 minutes left. Gary ignores this pop up and continues playing. At 12:00am, the pop up appeared again and told Gary to sleep. Gary ignores the pop up AGAIN but unfortunately, the computer froze forcing him to quit. Gary hits the settings and found out that he can change his computer brightness and the snooze time. He uses this and found the perfect schedule.&nbsp;</p>
