<p>When I try to plan my next schedule, I have to check a combination of websites, before deciding on what to enroll for my next quarter, including my Degree Audit, Academic History, UCSD CSE Major Requirements, UCSD CSE 2017-2018 Undergraduate Course Offerings, CAPE reviews, AS Grade Distributions, and RateMyProfessor to see what classes are available, which classes I need to take, and which professors/courses are good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main hack is to use a Google Spreadsheet, but now I've taken this up a further notch. With this new UI, a user can easily see the list of what requirements they have left to graduate, view their past quarters/plan their future quarters of classes, see ratings for courses, enroll/waitlist/plan courses through Webreg, and view their current progress/calendar of their next quarter's schedule, all in one webpage. Selecting a course will highlight which of the remaining requirements it fulfills, and the AS Grade Distributions, CAPE reviews, RateMyProfessor reviews are all provided for that class/professor, as well as the course prerequisite tree so the user can see what prereq courses they need to take first to enroll in this class, as well as what future courses this current course is a prerequisite for.</p>
