<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lead User</strong>: Victor Chen is a sophomore at UCSD, who enrolls in courses each quarter through the WebReg interface. However, it’s hard for him to know which courses he should take, especially with his goal of graduating on time in 4 years. To solve this problem, Victor uses a Google Spreadsheet to keep track of his remaining requirements, as well as his overall Four Year Plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: It’s Course Registration time for Spring Quarter, and Victor’s not sure what courses he should enroll in to meet his 4 year plan. He also wants to look for good grad courses to start planning to take in the future, and wants to see how that fits into his 4 year plan, in addition to needing to know which courses to first and second pass for this upcoming Spring Quarter.</p>
