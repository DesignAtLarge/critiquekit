<p>Chad is a software developer on Android who loves to create pixel perfect UI. Android OS offers some nice developer tools, but with the wide array of device sizes he often needs to double check to make sure all elements are properly sized and their proper location by installing manually and checking. If changes need to be made, he often needs to repeat this process until it is satisfactory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chad has just finished developing a new feature on an app he is developing and wants to make sure everything is properly sized and in its right place. He installs the application on different devices to check it out, but if he finds a problem he often needs to repeat this process which can be clunky and time consuming. A better interface would be a developer mode that allows the developer to see not only the padding/margin of different elements, but their locations and sizes overlaid on a grid over the whole screen. From there, Chad could free hand move elements around or use arrows to do pixel-by-pixel movements to ensure everything is properly sized and in its right place. Since the phone is connected to his laptop, once Chad makes changes they are automatically pushed to his developer environment, saving him time and monotony.&nbsp;</p>
