<p>Lead User: Max is a busy fourth year student at UCSD and relies heavily on alarms to wake him up and keep his schedule on track. Every morning he needs to go through his phone to track the time, weather and schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task: Max was woken up by Lexxie very early on the Saturday morning and the alarm told him he was going hiking with Emily in an hour. However, Max didnâ€™t remember he had the plan to go hiking. So Lexxie showed him the text he sent to Emily to remind him of when he set the plan.</p>
