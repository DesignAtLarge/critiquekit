<p dir="ltr">Max&nbsp;has never made brownies before but was assigned to make them for a student org potluck that he is a part of. For someone who does not bake, he doesn't feel confident in making them so he would like to watch a tutorial or have someone walk him through the process.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>TASK</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">When making something for a potluck, Max wants to make something easy. Max is assigned to make brownies. He wants reassurance that he is making them right when following the directions of the box because sometimes box instructions are vague. He wants to be able to make them even if he does not have a friend who bakes to help him.</p>
