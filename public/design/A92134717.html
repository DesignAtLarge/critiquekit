<p>The lead user is myself. I use excel to keep track of the expense and budget. I use excel because the available tools out there are not light-weight or efficient enough to actually help me understand my spending pattern or notify me of my financial situation before I spend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this video, you will see how the prototype of a smart wallet realizes the three primal goals&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. controlling total spending</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Learning where money goes</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Setting realistic goals</p>
<p>I will first add the categories of spending and the total spending budget of the month. Then link the card and phone to the wallet. Whenever I take out my wallet, the screen will show me some potential categories of spending depending on my location. I will choose the category of spending before spending. The screen will show statistics of that category. Then, since the card is linked to the wallet, the amount of spending will automatically go under that category. The home screen would be for the overview and small adjustments.</p>
