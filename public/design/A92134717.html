<p>Task,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The task is to find a way for people who keep track of their expenses without ever forgetting again and to help them really stick to the budget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My design is to change the cover of a wallet into a screen. Every time you try to open the wallet, the screen will ask you to log the category of expense and show your current status in sticking to the budget. The wallet scan the amount of out-going cash or synchronize with the bank account to complete the log.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspiration,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current budgeting and expense tracking designs out there do not ensure the users will log their expense every day. Even one of the best designs "mint" fails to do that. Mint link your cards to the account and automatically log your expense into categories. However, once it does that, there would be no more motivation for the users to check the app regularly to log cash expenses or to review the budget. Because they might think "everything (most) is taken care of the system". Instead of settling with a way that encourages the users to review everything at the end of the night, I looked for a way to remind the user every time before they spend.</p></span>
