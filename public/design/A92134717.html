<p>This prototype is for pregnant woman and their family to track the data during pregnancy, and learn about the knowledge to prepare for a baby. </p>
<p>Juliet and Romeo are expecting their first baby. Juliet needs a convenient way of keeping track of data, learning about what sheâ€™s doing wrong, get connected with other moms, and record her progress in pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inch scale helps keep track of data on-the-go. It monitors how's the mom doing and prompts notifications and warnings.</p>
<p>The foot scale is mainly for learning purposes. The default articles suggested are selected based on the data retrieved during the day. eg. If the watch detects seafood and prompts a notification of "Stay away from seafood", the foot scale interface will suggest an article of pregnancy diet.</p>
<p>The yard scale is for the family to remember the how far they've come through the entire process. It is a wall of photos or a smart mirror that can overlap your current image with some image before so the new mom can see the physical change during the process.</p>
