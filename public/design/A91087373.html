<div>My choice:</div>
<div>Puzzle solver</div>
<div></div>
<div>I did a contextual inquiry with Cathy, who is obsessed with puzzles. She could solve a 1000 pieces puzzle only in a few days. I asked her to describe her process of sorting puzzles, her thought process and also the extra help she used in order to solve a puzzle.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>She said she used to use several small plastic bags to put her sorted puzzles. She usually sort by colors or patterns, but right now since there arenâ€™t that many bags available, she did not use bags for the one she is currently working on.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>She also showed me two of her works. One is already completed and being sticked to the wall and the other one is in the progress. It is really interesting how she put her puzzles in progress. Because of the limited space in her apartment, she used a wasted cardboard and put it on her small desk to support the puzzle, which kind of like a extended desk. She can also bring the cardboard onto the floor when needed. She also put white paper on it so that the puzzle is visually clear for her to put it.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The already completed one is easily put on the wall because she used the cardboard to support the piece. It enabled her to easily used duck tape to spread across the puzzle and keep it together.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The two pictures show the two puzzles she showed to me.&nbsp;</div>
