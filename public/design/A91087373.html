<p>My lead user:</p>
<p>Cathy Cai is a junior college student interested in DIY home decor or other useful tools, especially different sort of plant pots. She has a keen eye seeing opportunities in many of things around her. For example, some cups or bottles seemed to be garbage in other household. In her hand, they can be turned into artifacts. On the other hand, as a college student, she would like to have some opportunity to earn some extra money for daily use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario:</p>
<p>Tracy is browsing online for ideas of plant pots on her desk. She finds some super interesting plant pots ideas on pineterest. Although for this particular idea, I found tutorial, I do not have the proper tool to craft it. With the help of DIY for Sale, I post the product picture and the tutorial offering 10 dollars for someone who can make this for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other side, Cathy, a college student, loves DIY stuff. She searched on DIY for sale and saw Tracyâ€™s offering. Although it is hard for Tracy to cut open a glass bottle and DIY this plant pot, she can do it in half an hour. She also had the tools needed, such as alcohol, glass bottle and string. She accepted the request from Tracy and post her completed work online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Tracy received the unique DIY plant pot she wanted, Cathy earned some extra dollars and enjoyed the crafting experience.</p>
