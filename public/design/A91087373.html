<div>My lead user is my roommate Cathy who loves plants and enjoys DIY different sorts of plant pots out of bottles, glasses, etc. I get inspiration from her idea of DIY these plant pots and thought of my mom. My mom loves plants and home decors, but always had a hard time finding suitable and unique plant pots. Then I searched on google photos for ideas. There are so many interesting ideas online about plant pots. However, tutorials are rarely found.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Based on all the observations, I came up with the idea of creating a website or platform about sharing plant pots resources. College students who have time and &nbsp;mind to ideate and create can share their inspirations with house keepers or other busy workers who need these ideas to decorate space.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>I came up with two ideas.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>First, inspired by the pottery game on iPad, potential seekers of plant pots can post their need online, where students can view and post their DIY pots online that satisfied the buyers need. Then, the buyer can purchase the one that best fit her need.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Second, plant pots seekers who saw a photo of plant pot them really like can post that photo online and ask for tutorials and tool kits to make that DIY pot. By crowdsourcing and ideation, the resources and information are shared.&nbsp;</div>
