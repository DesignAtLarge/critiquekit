<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p><strong>Persona:</strong></p>
<p>Muhammed is a college post-grad who has just bought his first apartment. Enamored with the tech world and with a healthy dose of environmental mindfulness, he has tricked out the apartment with the state of the art Smart Home tech and appliances both to nerd-out and minimize his carbon footprint (as well as streamline his at-home experience).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Inch:</b></p>
<p>The smartwatch interface provides portability and consistency at the price of small screen real estate. It's main interaction is through voice, so Muhammed can at any time at home issue a command along the lines of, "toggle movie mode", and quickly alter the ambiance of his home and turn on the tv without the physical exertion otherwise necessary in a physical home. Beyond voice, there are 4 quick options for Lights, Temperature, Entertainment, and Off where he can alter the settings of the smarthome devices in the room he's currently in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Foot:</strong></p>
<p>The tablet interface mimics the layout of Muhammed's home so he can intuitively customize appliance settings in any room of the house. Using Multitouch zoom to further inspect a room expands the options to&nbsp;more customization features such as light hue and brightness along with relevant needs more complicated than a basic toggle. Quick settings in the center of the screen allow for him to toggle pre-determined configurations of his appliances. The voice button in the bottom right allows him to issue quick voice commands to alter his home settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yard:</strong></p>
<p>The yard interface takes the form of a Smart Mirror placed in Muhammed's bedroom. Every morning when he wakes up he is able to check himself out while digesting relevant content from his virtual life and customizing his smart-home settings. He is given a weather digest, Smart-Home overview, news feed, and reminders list to get him started on the right foot and ready to tackle the day. All options are interactable.</p>
