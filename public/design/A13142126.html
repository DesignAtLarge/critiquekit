<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jasper Travers is constantly reading research papers submitted to HCI and UIST. In reading these papers, he wishes to better take notes on them that allow him to (1) understand on the paper, (2) prepare for presentation or discussion on the paper and (3) connect (1) and (2) among different papers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario:</p>
<p>Jasper is reading a specific research paper:&nbsp;<strong>Code and Contribution in Interactive Systems Research</strong> submitted to CHI and wants to discuss this paper related to the previous ~10 papers he has read in the class. So he wants to create an organization system that lets this paper influence an organization scheme in which he can attach the other papers.</p>
