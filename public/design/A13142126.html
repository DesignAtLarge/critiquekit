<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jasper recently dislocated his shoulder, and it occurred due to strength issues related to bad posture. He wants to be more cognizant of his posture and to be able to easily receive feedback on the motions of getting into better posture. He wants to be able to work on posture with a visual guide to his body and be able to do so both inside and outside of the athletic trainer facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inch:</p>
<p>The task for the smart watch is to constantly remind users to be cognizant of their posture. This is done through clear visual and haptic feedback focusing on relaying changes in posture to the user. This rewards users for maintaining and increasing good posture and gives warning cues in the moment of transitioning into bad posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Food:</p>
<p>The task for the tablet is to self-teach good posture, and real time reflect on current posture. This is done by showing the user a model of themselves and giving text and visual instructions of the next most important thing they can do to fix their posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yard:</p>
<p>The task is for an athletic trainer to give instructions on movements to the athlete. This is done by verbalizing a target task to the wall computer and then having both the trainer and computer be able to show the athlete the correct motions to fix posture. This monitor also functions similar to a mirror so the athlete may fine tune their position according to color highlight cues.</p></span>
