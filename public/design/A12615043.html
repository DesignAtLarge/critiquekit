<p>Kaylie Lu, a college student who is planning a hackathon. She wants to be able to assign people tasks, view all relevant files and the current status of planning, manage social media, and track progress in the same location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaylie wants to view progress on the hackathon all on the same page. The progress she wants to see is how sponsorship, finding hackers, volunteers, and mentors is going, as well as everyone's individual tasks as well as what has been completed. She also wants to assign a person, RB, to a team "People" so he can follow that the progress related to finding people for the hackathon. She also notices that there are not enough hackers so she assigns him the task of getting more hackers.&nbsp;</p>
