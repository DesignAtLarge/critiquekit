<p>I’m an exchange student at UCSD. I sometimes use Uber to go somewhere and want to get a cheap ride by avoiding surge price.</p>

<p>Scenario: </p>
<p>It is 5:30 pm, Monday. I’m going to order a Uber at 3779 La Jolla Village Dr to go to Old Town Transit Center. When I open the Uber app, I’m in a surge region and the price is higher than normal due to increased demand. I'm not in a hurry and do not want to pay extra money for surge. Then I open another website to check surge regions. In this website, I could clearly see surge regions around me and find the closest location with low surge price. I can choose to wait at current location or walk to that location within 5-10 min. If I choose to walk there, I can use my iWatch to help navigation. Current Surge and time show on my watch. After I arrive at 4059 La Jolla Village Drive, I check Uber app again, I’m not in surge region and the fare drops down. So I can order a car here and save half of the money.</p>
