<p dir="ltr">Lead User and what they bring:</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lead user is Hans Yuan- a car enthusiast who would rather solve simple car issues on his own than go to a mechanic for potentially costly repairs. He sifts through the web to find solutions to his car problem, using YouTube and public forums to search for what people are saying but often there are many random, irrelevant chatter and responses that offer identical solutions. Also as he has good knowledge of working on cars, he is sometimes in a position to give advice to others who need it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Task/Problem the design aims to solve:</p>
<p dir="ltr">This design aims to solve the task of grouping issues and answers together into a single post, where the problem is identified and the solutions are provided in a single screen and pass through.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Common Case: The issue is identified and the solution is easily found. </p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Uncommon Case: The issue is identified and I provide a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p>**correction to the uncommon case in the PDF- the highlighted part should say "The issue is identified and I provide a solution."</p>
