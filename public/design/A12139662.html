Time is crunched for him so he does everything in his power to minimize wasted time. For lecture, he likes to take notes with his own personalized method of note taking. Each section has its own formatting which can be time consuming. He has tried traditional note taking and has tried variations of the bullet journaling method, neither of which worked for him. He is constantly changing his method of note taking so having the ability to customize at his own pace is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task: Adi is in calculus class, which has a lot of notes and concepts to learn. He knows he is going into calculus class beforehand and sets up his preferred formatting of notes (one which works well for his math/science classes). The note taking app knows his formatting method and all Adi needs to go in and do is select the label and begin taking notes. This app allows him to quickly take notes without having to fuss around with formatting and he is able to view multiple screens and navigate his entire note taking folder at ease.&nbsp;</p>
