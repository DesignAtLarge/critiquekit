Time is crunched for him so he does everything in his power to minimize wasted time. For lecture, he likes to take notes with his own personalized method of note taking. Each section has its own formatting which can be time consuming. He has tried traditional note taking and has tried variations of the bullet journaling method, neither of which worked for him. He is constantly changing his method of note taking so having the ability to customize at his own pace is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Adi is in calculus class, which has a lot of notes and concepts to learn. He knows he is going into calculus class beforehand and sets up his preferred formatting of notes (one which works well for his math/science classes). As his style is constantly changing, he sets up a new note page to update and customize to his preferred specifications. Once everything is set up, it is just up to him to plug away at taking notes and the tablet will automatically update with his formatting preferences. The style that is working today may be different tomorrow so he will make adjustments tomorrow and see what needs to be changed to make note taking even quicker.</p>
