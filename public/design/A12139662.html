<p>My lead user is an engineering student who has had trouble in the past finding the right notebook that suits his needs. They are often too small, too large, or formatted in such a way that does not promote good note taking. He has often resorted to creating his own formatting technique that is a hack of the bullet journaling technique. This design is inspired by the customizability of a traditional notebook with the technology of a tablet. Users are able to format a paragraph of text and label each section of the paragraph. The tablet learns which section is which and allows the users to freely take notes in class and the tablet will know how to automatically format the text to the user preference. Ultimately, the task is to allow users to quickly note take using their preferred method while also having the convenience and editing ability of a tablet.</p>
