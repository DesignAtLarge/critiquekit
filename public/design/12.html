<p><strong>LEAD USER:</strong>&nbsp;My lead user is my assistant technical director, Stephen. In addition to his role as TD (scene switcher), Stephen runs CG operation for Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament broadcasts--since he has yet to retire from competitive play (as do most production staff), Stephen wanted to figure out a method of CG operation in which scoring and text updates would be done without his constant input. In essence, this lead design was driven by his desire to play more video games, and to work less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen's proposed design involves a 7-in RPi touchscreen interface - in which the players competing on the live stream setup would input their own scores after each win, through an increment via single-tap. Here is a diagram of data flow:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>TASK:&nbsp;</b>Stephen is in charge of CG operation - "Character Generation", including dynamic text (scoreboard/names) updates to indicate match progression to our viewers. Stephen's goal with his interface, named "StreamLord", is to allow for players to operate CG via touch-screen interface. Player names would automatically be drawn from the pre-registration bracket data, and thus scoring could be done without the need for his constant oversight.</p>
