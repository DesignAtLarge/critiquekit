Julie is a third-year college student who realizes that the habits that she has picked up from her college career has turned her lifestyle into an unhealthy one. Julie stays up and sleeps late, forgets to drink water, and binge-eat late at night. She wants to start to build healthier habits but she feels confused by all of the nutritional vocabulary of polyunsaturated fats, complex carbohydrates, etc. She just wants to know if she's on the right track and if not, what could so she do to fix it.

Inch 
When midterm season rolls around, Julie often forgets to drink enough water and often eats unhealthy snacks like chips in between meals. With the smartwatch, it will remind Julie to take water breaks and keep track of whether or not she is building healthy habits. She will also get reminders to eat healthy snacks instead and a swipe right will indicate that she has eaten healthy snacks whereas a swipe left will indicate she has not. With this, she is able to track if she is building better habits.

Yard
The screen shows how well she has been doing over the past month. Each day has a health bar that is determined by her sleep quality, food/water intake, and exercise amount. This is just to give her an overall idea of how well she has been doing the past few days and to motivate her to continue doing better.
