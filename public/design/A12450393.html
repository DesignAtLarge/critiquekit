She recently learned about virtual reality and thinks that having experiences in VR is much more immersive than traditional video viewing. She wears glasses so she would like her glasses to fit inside of the headset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> She wants to relax at home and watch her favorite podcast on YouTube. It is is shot using 360 video and she will be viewing it inside her Google Cardboard virtual reality headset for about 20 minutes. She wants to be able to fit her glasses inside her headset because her vision becomes blurry without her glasses. She wants to be able to watch her videos without having to constantly be holding the headset up to her face. Furthermore, she wants to be able to snack on popcorn while she is watching the 360 video and relaxing at home.&nbsp;</p>
