In this scenario, our user is wanting to watch a 360 interactive video. She wants to be able to use the "tap" functionality to select from different options but does not want to be holding the headset to her face or having to user the trigger on the side of the headset. She wants to be able to adjust the volume and take screenshots of really interesting scenes within the video. She would like to have a way of interacting with the headset with very little use of her hands and arms. The watch interface solves this issue, since she can simply rest her arms on her table and tap/swipe on her watch whenever appropriate. The headset straps allow her to keep the headset on her head without having to hold it up to her face herself.</p>
