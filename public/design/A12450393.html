<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>The lead user for this scenario is myself. I am very active in the virtual reality community and regularly wear virtual reality head mounted displays (HMD). One of the most simple and accessible VR headsets is the Google Cardboard. It is very affordable compared to most VR headsets. Many school programs have been implementing them in their classrooms to teach students concepts in a more immersive and engaging way. One problem that I have with the Google Cardboard is that the user must hold up the headset to their face during the entire experience. I would like there to be some detachable temple bars that would sit comfortable over the ears, like regular eye glasses do. It is very annoying to have to constantly hold up your Cardboard headset to your face, and quite frankly, makes the Cardboard lose the VR immersion factor. Another issue is with the fact that the headset is made of cardboard, which is a very porous and dry material. If you have ever looked at a used pizza box, you will see that cardboard absorbs oils very well. The same happens when users put the Google Cardboard up to their faces. The cardboard will absorb the natural oils found on the user's forehead and will stay there permanently. This makes the headset look dirty and unhygienic, and might deter other users from wanting to try out the headset. I frequently add stickers or tape to this part of the headset, so that no oils are visible. The sticker or tape can easily be wiped after a user is done with the headset.&nbsp;</p>
