<p><strong>Lead User:</strong> Corrin is a UCSD student who likes to study in quiet places like Geisel. However, one day she finds out that there is no space in Geisel, so she tries to find a place that isn’t crowded and ends up studying in Starbucks. The music in the background, the table of people next to her, and the coffee machines are all too loud, so Corrin has a hard time focusing. She can’t use noise canceling headphones because they make her dizzy, so she has no choice but to blast music in her earbuds, which hurt her ears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> The interface allows users to be able to concentrate in any situation. It is designed to block different types of noises and will play different concentration music that can help them with their studies. By providing different modes and sound, the interface is a life saver when it comes to someone who is having a hard time focusing in a busy environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Common Case:</strong> Someone who is having trouble concentrating in a busy environment</p>
<p><strong>Uncommon Case:</strong> When trying to avoid someone in the same environment.</p>
