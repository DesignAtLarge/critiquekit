<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> I used to walk from campus to my apartment late at night. For 40 minutes, I would often feel nervous and would constantly think of different ways to pass the time. Most of the time, I would use my phone to listen to music, read articles, play games, etc. while walking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> My app allows for activities to engage with on a mobile device while traveling. The task is for a late-night commuter to pass the time by faster while walking back home for appx. 40 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> The user will be asked how much time they plan on traveling. Afterward, they can select an activity to do and either listen or speak into their phones for the specified amount of time. Users can listen to music or podcasts, respond to a given topic and self-reflect on themselves verbally or write a novel by saying out loud a story.</p>
