<p><strong>Lead User:&nbsp;</strong>Justin is a college student who is afraid of walking home alone at night. He needs a way to be alerted of any potential dangers near him as he's traveling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:&nbsp;</strong>Justin is walking home alone at night. He uses the 360Hearing app and headpiece in order to detect if any suspicious noises are approaching him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally I had just the app, however, I added in a physical headpiece component in order to address the issue of how annoying the app would be if there just happened to be a bunch of runners near him at night. So, using bone-induction hearing inspired tech, I made it so that if the headpiece detects a suspicious noise, it would alert him through the side of his skull, rather than through the earbuds (if he's even wearing any).</p>
