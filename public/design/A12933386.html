<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p><b>User:&nbsp;</b>Thomas is a student who has midterms coming up. He wants to study hard, however, his friend suddenly called and Thomas ended up playing League of Legends when he should have been sleeping at 10PM like he said he would. Thomas needs a way to stay focused and not get distracted by his friends or League of Legends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inch:&nbsp;</strong>Thomas is the kind of guy who likes to start whatever he needs to do fast. Using his smart watch, Thomas can simply smack the screen and say out loud the time frame he wants to activate his blacklist for contacts and apps. He can also stop the blocking period, but only if he can verify that it's an emergency based on his tone and diction.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Foot:&nbsp;</strong>Thomas likes to plan out his day and week and prioritize his tasks. Using a tablet, Thomas can jot down tasks and rearrange them as he pleases into public (viewable by his apartment mates) and private. He can also make lists for banned contacts and apps, emergency contacts and apps, and okay contacts and apps. When in front of the apartment bulletin board, Thomas can also use his tablet to suggest events to his apartment mates as notes in the case that they're not readily available.</p>

<p><strong>Yard:&nbsp;</strong>Thomas likes to maintain good communication with his apartment mates. He can use his tablet when in front of the bulletin board to leave notes and suggest events to his apartment mates, based on which date is selected, who's name is swiped, and what their current contact status is. When afar, Thomas can see the schedule of the person currently selected based on an hour-forward, hour-backward interval around the current time, as well as a summary of their contact status.</p>
