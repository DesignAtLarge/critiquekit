<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p><strong>Lead User:&nbsp;</strong>Justin is a college student who is afraid of walking home alone at night. He needs a way to be alerted of any potential dangers near him as he's traveling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:&nbsp;</strong>Justin is walking home from school late at night. To make sure that no one gets the jump on him, Justin uses the 360Hearing app while he's listening to his music through his earbuds. The app uses the phone's microphone to analyze the surrounding environment's noise and then compares the varying sounds with a database to check for any potentially danger-related sounds. If a potential danger is detected, the app sends a text message similar to an Amber Alert in that it overrides whatever is currently going on in the phone and displays an emergency message while playing a harsh alarm. Justin can then react faster, or at least in the nick of time, than had he not had the app in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
