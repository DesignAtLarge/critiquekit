<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p><strong>Lead User:&nbsp;</strong>The lead user is Stephen, my assistant technical director. Since Stephen hasn't quite come to terms with retiring from competitive play (as many aspiring directors do), he often would rather compete at a smaller local event rather than running CG operation all evening. Since local events generally have smaller viewership, automating CG operation would allow for Stephen to compete in bracket without fear of losing the quality which CG operation brings to a broadcast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> create an interface by which CG operation is controlled by the Tournament Organizer and the players competing on stream themselves. As trained CG operators are low on availability and expensive to hire, allowing for automatic scoreboard update via player-accessible touchscreen interface can potentially bring high-level production value to low-budget event broadcasts. Events which operators cannot attend would still be properly scored, startup TO organizations could broadcast their events without having to hire a full-time broadcaster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration:&nbsp;</strong>Stephen is IRL my assistant TD, and is in process of actually developing the back-end into a working system based on&nbsp;python, google docs, and the StreamControl program.</p>
