<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Rather than being stuck operating character generation all day (updating scores on stream), Stephen developed a remote stream control interface by which the players on stream themselves could update the scores, rather than relying on the presence of a CG operator to get the job done. In this manner, high-level cg operation can be maintained, without the need to hire extra assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this scenario, after a single match is completed (but before the set [best out of 3] is completeted), the players themselves are able to access a touchscreen interface to control CG operation on stream, allowing for accurate score updates without a CG operator present.&nbsp;</p>
