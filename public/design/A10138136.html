As he is often on his feet, Mike wants alternative methods of editing the scoreboard overlays dynamically without having to be physically present at his desk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yard: Containing a preview of the actual overlay, the yard interface is utilized through voice commands. Mike can interact with an AI in a similar manner to an actual production studio, in which he would be directing another operator to update a particular field with particular commands.</p>
