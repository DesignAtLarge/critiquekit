<p><b>Lead User</b>: Victor is a junior at UCSD majoring in Computer Science, who wants to know what courses to enroll in for next year, so that he can fulfill his Four Year Plan and graduate on time. Victor’s lead user hack is to use a Google Spreadsheet to keep track of the remaining requirements he has to do, as well as plan his Four Year Plan and what courses he plans to take each quarter. He does this to compile the necessary information about classes and his 4 year plan from 10 different links into one central location, allowing him to be easily organized for identifying the courses that he needs to take. Victor doesn’t really care about considering other options such as the 5th year MS program or a minor right now, his primary focus is to graduate on time and take the best courses with the best professors.</p>
