<p><b>User</b>: Victor is a junior at UCSD majoring in Computer Science, who wants to know what courses to enroll in for next year, so that he can fulfill his Four Year Plan and graduate on time. Victor doesnâ€™t really care about considering other options such as the 5th year MS program or a minor right now, his primary focus is to graduate on time and take the best courses with the best professors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Tasks:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>Find which courses satisfy your remaining requirements.&nbsp;</li><li>Be able to see which professors are the most recommended for a course</li><li>Register for courses for any quarter, and see what to first/second pass</li></ul></span>
