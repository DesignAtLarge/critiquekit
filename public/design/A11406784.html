<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p><strong>Persona:</strong>&nbsp;Tim is a pretty tech-savvy guy who works as a waiter at&nbsp;a restaurant. The restaurant has some money to spend on new devices, so Tim is envisioning&nbsp;ways to increase responsiveness to customers to provide better&nbsp;service and satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inch:</strong> Tim needs to identify at a glance what customers would like help with and when, anticipating where&nbsp;he is needed next in the restaurant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Foot</strong>:&nbsp;Tim&nbsp;needs to streamline the order process, giving customers an interactive menu that they can order off of without having to wait for a waiter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yard:</strong> Tim wants a nice interface that visually represents the tables and restaurant patrons, showing their status and other information such as reservations and the waitlist. It would&nbsp;also allow him to manage taking customer payments.</p>
