<p>Julian Sainz is a lighting tech who works for an events company that gets hired out to do small scale gigs like school dances and company functions. His&nbsp;job is to set up and program light sequences that he controls in eye-catching ways during a DJ set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>Julian is looking for ways to speed the setup time on programming light sequences because it's very repetitive work. Due to the clunky controls of the lighting controller he currently&nbsp;works with, he has to manually select each light fixture and record in real time the movements and color changes that he wants shown. Sequences also can't be edited, so if Julian messes up while recording an action he has to start over again. There are also no visualizations or ways to preview what he's doing on the controller, so he essentially needs to practice and memorize the different sequences he's going to use during the performance. A better hardware interface would allow Julian to select and record actions for multiple lighting fixtures at once, and edit actions for saved sequences on the fly- changing the color, intensity or speed of any light hooked up to the controller.</p>
