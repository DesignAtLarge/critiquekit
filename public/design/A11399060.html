<p>Drew is a college student who is living in a house off campus in San Diego. He always forgets to turn off his lights when he leaves the house so he needs to be able to turn off his lights easily before leaving the house or when he's left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inch: Drew's watch will notify him which light is left on and he can use voice control to turn it off. After turning it off, it will tell him the increase in energy efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foot: Drew's foot interface is a control panel that is located next to the garage control panel. He can check and turn off the lights before he leaves the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yard: Drew's yard interface is a touch display that allows Drew to see the current lights on, calendar, to do list, energy he is saving, and areas he needs to&nbsp;be more energy efficient on.&nbsp;</p>
