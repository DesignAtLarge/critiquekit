<p>Joey Wong, a college student, likes traveling and&nbsp;staying in hostels. She is planning her summer trip to Europe this summer and needs to figure out which hostels are best to stay at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SCENARIO</strong></p>
<p>Joey will be in Amsterdam and needs to find a hostel that is decent, convenient, and affordable. She would like a way to see where the hostel she is considering is located in relation to the places she would like to visit, if the hostel is decently rated, and if the price is affordable all in one place.</p>
