<p><strong>Design:</strong>&nbsp;The interface displays a map of Amsterdam on the left side and the right side features a search with results displaying on the button. When selecting a hostel, in this case, Hostel Melvana, it shows the reviews that people have left. Then on the map, you see it update with where Hostel Melvana is located. You can also add places you want to visit with the "+" icon on the bottom left of the map. It will tell you where the places are in relation to the hostel you are considering staying at.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> My inspiration is my friend from back home who likes to travel a lot but on budget. She actually enjoys staying at hostels because of the culture but hates finding one for her trip because she always has to cross check so many different platforms before choosing one she thinks will be affordable, decent, and convenient.</p>
