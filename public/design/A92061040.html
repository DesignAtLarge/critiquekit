<p>Hololens is famous for its ability to let people map holographic world to the real world and interact with Holograms using gesture control. But the problem is that when the User (who wears the Hololens) is interacting with the Hologram, the Spectator (who stands by without Hololens) will have no idea what the User is looking at and what the User is actually manipulating with. This can be a serious issue especially when companies are doing Hololens application demo in a booth in a conference like CES or VR/AR Summit.</p>
