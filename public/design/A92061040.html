<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Domain:</strong> online shopping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Lead User:</strong> the new lead user is my cousin, Pauline Liu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong>&nbsp;Pauline often buy stuffs and things online, but when it comes to buying clothes online, it is often a problem that she doesn't know if the size of the clothes would actually fit her body because the standard of size varies across clothes from different manufactories especially when it is sold internationally. So sometimes she would choose the style of clothes she wants to buy online, and then go to the actual store to find the similar style of clothes and try it out. Through this lead user behavior, I think I can combine the process of selecting style of clothes online and actually try it out on body, which leads me to the design of a online clothes shopping prototype in virtual reality.</p>
