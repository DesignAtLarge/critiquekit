<p><strong>Lead User:</strong> Yining is a Hololens developer in the Immersive visualization lab in the UCSD. And there are often cases that he needs to demo his project or progress to other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Yining does a weekly progress demo to his professor and his team. Even though he projects his view to a computer screen every time while he is doing the demo using the Hololens, he hopes that other people can see what he is interacting with through their own perspective. To achieve that, he often just gives the other person another Hololens device and connects two device together, but he often encounters the problem that another Hololens in the Lab is not available. And even if another Hololens is available, only one person can use at a time. He mentioned that it would so great if there is a simple way to have everyone engaged in the AR experience at the same time. So I designed a interface for smartphone so that people can use their smartphone as a intermediate device between the virtual world and real world. Through the phone camera, people can share the virtual space at the same time.</p>
