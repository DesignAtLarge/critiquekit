<p><strong>Lead user</strong>:</p>
<p>Cecilia Le is a 4th year undergraduate student who annually plans snowboarding trips with 15-20 of her friends. She really looks forward to&nbsp;the trip but has to plan 4-5 months early because the logistics take a lot of time to sort out. She finds it difficult dealing with the invitation process because the number of people who can attend will influence other logistics like carpooling, amount of food, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong>:</p>
<p>The trip is typically 3-4 days and involves cabin rental, cooking/prep, snow gear, carpools, etc. In the video, Cecilia is viewing&nbsp;each of the 5 tabs to check the&nbsp;detailed status for each category. (1) In the attendance tab, she can see who has confirmed, declined, or is still undecided. She can choose to email the undecided guests&nbsp;to give them the trip updates and remind them to make a decision. (2) In the cost tab, she can view the list of expenses for the entire group as well as individual costs (total cost divided by the number of persons confirmed). She can send reminders to guests who haven't paid. &nbsp;(3) In the food tab, she can find the planned meals and the ingredients involved. She can see which items have been bought and also assign who to buy&nbsp;certain items. (4) In the carpool tab, she can use the list of riders and passengers to arrange carpool rides through simple drag and drop mechanism. (5) In the schedule tab, she can see the events that have been planned for each day.&nbsp;</p></span>
