<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>Persona: Victoria is a 4th year student at UCSD. She occasionally takes trips to downtown LA or SD and often has trouble finding parking. She wants a way to access information about parking spots around her destination and the availabilities in parking structures so she can go there directly without wasting time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task:</p>
<p>- Inch: Victoria is in her car, driving around downtown looking for a street parking spot. She rolls next to a spot and sees 3 parking signs, all stating different limitations. She wants to know if she can park there without having to decipher the parking signs.</p>
<p>- Foot: Victoria is driving to a restaurant downtown and wants to know which route/street has the most parking available so she doesn't end up driving far away from the restaurant.</p>
<p>- Yard: Victoria is driving up to a parking structure, she wants to know if she has a shot at a parking spot on the first level or if she should immediately go to the second level.&nbsp;</p>
