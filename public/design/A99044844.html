<p>This design took inspiration from a lead user who is a&nbsp;college student who annually plans snowboarding trips to Big Bear. The plan involves a group of 15-20 people, a few overnight stays at a cabin, and gear rentals. To organize all of the logistics, she uses the spreadsheet to lay everything out. Although the Google Spreadsheet has its benefits, it's not built for this trip planning. In this case, the task is to organize the attendees, ensure sufficient amount of food, prepare all needed supplies, and facilitate a smooth trip. In order to do this, a lot of communication takes place amongst&nbsp;the planners and also between the planner and their guests. Google spreadsheet lacks many functionalities that would be useful for this task. For example, some details of the trip are contingent upon other things, such as how the amount of food or the individual cost could depend on the number of attendees. There is also no easy way to communicate all the information to each individual quickly and comprehensively. Small details may be important, such as dietary restrictions, types of clothing necessary, etc. For all of these reasons, I wanted to design an interface that presents the information much more orderly and facilitates efficient communication between the planners and guests. I designed the home page that shows a summary of each important category&nbsp;(attendance, food, etc.). The inner sections then allow easy management and messaging system to simplify the planning process.</p>
