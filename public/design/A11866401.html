<p>I've attempted to apply the keyboard shortcuts of a code editor to a note taking app. Headings, bullet points, bolding, and highlights can be applied by intuitive and quick keyboard shortcuts utilized on the fly while taking notes. Aesthetic conversion and display of the notes happens real time and gives the user a well spaced and clearly presented display of notes with minimal formatting input from the user. An outline is automatically applied on the right side based on&nbsp;headings. Bolded words are added to a vocab section and can be previewed anywhere in the app from other notes as well.</p>
