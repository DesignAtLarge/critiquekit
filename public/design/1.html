<p><strong>Lead User</strong>:</p>
<p>Reese is a CS major at University in a Humanities class. He finds typed notes most effective in class because of the pace of lecture. He fails to find an effective note taking app, however, as those at his disposal are either too cluttered with non-note-taking features or too basic. He heavily utilizes bullet points in Google Docs and hotkeys where they exist, however, also desires a more aesthetic presentation of the notes he takes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The task is to strike a balance between minimizing distraction from lecture and maximizing organization of ideas for later studying through the use of hotkeys and automatic formatting while taking notes.</p>
