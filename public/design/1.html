<p>Chad is a college student in a gender studies class â€“ the class format is heavily dependent on lecture, and contains many terms and concepts. He has a difficult time keeping up with the pace of lecture so he types his notes, however, he must make do with Google Docs which doesn't provide enough quick hotkeys for key note&nbsp;organization and formatting. He often needs to go back and check podcasts to catch things the professor said because of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong>:</p>
<p>Chad must take notes quickly and effectively, organizing&nbsp;the lecture content in a means that will easily allow him to study it later. In addition to the lecture slides, he needs to take note of pertinent information the professor shares as it will be relevant during his exams.</p>
