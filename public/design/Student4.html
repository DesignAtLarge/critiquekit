<p>Everyday, we are access to all kinds of information, some of those are useful while some are not. If you spend some time to find out the piece of info that matters to you, but there’s no good way to save them, or not easily to retrieve later on, it would be ineffective and kind of waste of time.</p>
<p>
So far, there are different kinds of ways to collect information, we save sites on browser, save documents on computer, save favorites in some app, they are all separate, next time, when you want to find something that you’ve read before, but hardly can you remember where’s it. You find something then save it where it was, the loop ends. So there is a need for such a tool helps people organize all types of information from different sources and offer people a simple way to search within the results and share with others.</p>
