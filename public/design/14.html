<p><strong>LEAD USER:</strong>&nbsp;Chen is a research assistant in the Design Lab who often sits in front of the laptop for tons of hours dealing with interface design works without moving his body. However, he is in bad need of the motivation to exercise to avoid vertebra or lumbar diseases. So he often sets an alarm to remind himself of standing up to move and stretch his body after using computer for certain amount of time.</p>
<p><br><strong>TASK:</strong>&nbsp;On the Saturday Morning, Chen brings his laptop to the Design Lab hoping to work on his research for the whole day and sets the alarm as usual. However, when the alarm rings, Chen doesnâ€™t want his progress to be interrupted, so he just turns the alarm off in order to focus on his work, oblivious of his ambition of doing exercises while using computer. Therefore, Chen really needs a better way of motivation to help him regularly stretch his body, move around a little, and most importantly, have a little fun break from his intense work.</p>
