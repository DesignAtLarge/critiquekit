<p>Students want to waste less time on the internet and be more productive. In this scenario, a student can list out the websites they don't want to spend time on and the websites they would like to spend more time on. Then when they go on to use the internet as normal, the application will switch out bad websites with good websites automatically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karen wastes a lot of time on the internet. She gets easily distracted by dog videos and other popular content online. To redirect her time spent on the internet, she changes her defaults views on applications such as reddit and Youtube to only educational content. While other types of content are still available to her if necessary, by adding more steps, she still wastes time online instead of doing homework but now she's learning relevant information instead.&nbsp;</p></span>
