<p><strong>LEAD USER</strong></p>
<p>Ellen Yang (myself) is part of a student organization who plans socials for their members to try to build a stronger community. To encourage more people to come, she tries to arrange carpools for members so as many people as possible can come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SCENARIO</strong></p>
<p>Ellen and her org are organizing a social to the SD County Fair next month and are trying to arrange carpools for everyone. Currently, she uses Google Forms and Google Sheets for arranging carpools and manually tries to assign passengers to cars&nbsp;in the most efficient way for drivers (e.g., based on location). However, it is time consuming, and as a busy student herself, it is hard to consistently do this for every social. She wishes there was a way 1) to have everything in one place and 2) to automatically&nbsp;assign &amp; easily arrange passengers to cars so that it's most efficient for drivers.</p></span>
