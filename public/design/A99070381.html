<p>Lead User: I like to explore the city and museum and I am constantly looking for inspiration from daily subject. However, every time I encounter something I am interested in, I need to take picture and search all the information about it myself. The process takes too long and the photos and information in my phone is cluttered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video shows a pairs of AR glasses&nbsp;that can detect the subject and tell you what it is about. The AR glasses are paired with bluetooth earphone, which function as a personal assistant. You can talk to her all the time and ask about everything.</p></span>
