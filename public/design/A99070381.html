<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>Task: Let someone helps me understand the subject I don't know, it can be an object or concept, anything describable. For example, more specifically, Leo is going to a Tate Britain and he likes one of the paintings, Ophelia. He knows a little about the background, but wants to know more about it.</p>
<p>Concept and design: Instead of standing in front of a painting and pulling your phone to take a picture to scan the painting, I design the situation to be like standing in front of the painting and ask your "personal assistant"(I will say Maxxie&nbsp;for now) to tell you what painting it is. Say, Leo is standing in front of "Ophelia" and he asks "Tell me about this painting" and then Maxxie will tell Leo through the earphone he's wearing. When he says "show me the details", Maxxie will vibrate his phone, telling him the content is ready. And Leo can pull out his phone and see the details(the prototype I designed). In the text and image mode, it is more like wikipedia and in the AR mode, different description of the painting will be shown on the screen.</p>
<p>Inspiration: Every time I went to a museum, lots of people wear headphones to listen to the audio guide, so I realized museum is the perfect place for the user + guide model. I originally just wanted to design the guide as an app on phone, which enable you to "see an object in&nbsp;augmented reality style", but yesterday Google announced Google Lens, the idea very similar to my concept, so I want to put it further, to the extent that users&nbsp;don't even need the phone. And then I realized my idea is actually similar to the OS in the movie "Her". I can't say it is my inspiration, but I know it'll become reality in the future.</p>
