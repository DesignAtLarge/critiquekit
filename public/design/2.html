<p>Lead User: Our lead user took an uber home late at night once and realized she put herself in an uncomfortable position. She felt unsafe because the driver asked invasive questions and she didn't feel like she could do anything to protect herself. What she did do is keep her phone out, ready to call/text for help if the situation escalated. We used her action as insights for our design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task: Our user is going home from school late at night and wants to use a ridesharing app but also wants to feel safe getting into a stranger's car at night by herself.</p>
