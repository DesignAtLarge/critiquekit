<p dir="ltr">As part of a student organization, Ellen plans social events for the members in order to build a stronger community within the org. To encourage more people to come, she arranges carpools for members so that those who want to come can have rides to the socials and get to know others better. However, assigning passengers to cars and giving participants the information they need is a common hindrance.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>TASK</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">When arranging carpools for the organizationâ€™s social events, Ellen finds it hard to assign passengers to cars in a way that would be most efficient in terms of time and gas. She also wants to easily contact participants to give them pertinent information (automatic notifications/updates on pick up times, driver arrival, etc.) without having to message everyone individually.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Common Case:</strong> Someone signs up for a carpool to be picked up at the designated time</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Exception Case:</strong> Someone who can't leave at the designated pickup time but would still like a ride</p>
