<p><strong>Leader user:</strong> </p>
<p>Jeff is a 22 year old college student who loves to snowboard. He has been snowboarding since he was 9 years old and likes to go extremely fast on runs (50-60 mph). He mentally calculates how fast he thinks he is going and checks an app at the end of the day to see his top speeds. Sometimes the app he uses doesnâ€™t record properly so he writes down his estimates as well. To optimize his time on the runs he does not look at the app on his phone until the end of the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task/Problem: </strong></p>
<p>Our design is an apple watch interface that Jeff can use while he is snowboarding. It shows him his speed in real time and is large enough that he can see it with a quick glance while snowboarding. All of the information is shared and recorded by the app he uses, created by TRACE.</p>
<p>- Common case: Slope</p>
<p>- Uncommon case: Terrain</p>
