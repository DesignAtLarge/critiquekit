<p dir="ltr"><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">My lead user Sharon, a senior international student in UC San Diego, is eagerly seeking for jobs including internships, part-time jobs and full-time jobs to build up her experience. At the beginning, she met a large problem on managing them because here are so many applications that it is difficult for her to keep track of every step. Sometimes, she forgot when was the application open and end, when she needed to upload the resume or portfolio, when her interview started, and etc. In order to help herself to solve those problem, she writes down all the information into one notebook and categorizes them into sections. Inspiring by her notebook, I would like to invent an app that has clean and clear interfaces on digital devices to help her manage applications in a more effective and efficient way.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">People who is pursuing internships, part-time jobs or full-time jobs make use of this app to manage their applications. After imported information about jobs, the system will remind the users of future events or next tasks needed to be done or prepared. At the same time, users keep track of each step by writing notes or uploading files and check current progress of every job by filtering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p><br>My design, inspiring by the organization of Sharon’s notebook, helps people check their application status and keep track of application progress, in an attempt to increase the possibility that users get their desire jobs. This is the interface designed for tablet or laptop. In this app, every user has his or her own account with personal application portfolio. The left bar shows the user’ portrait picture and username on the top and contains several filters for user to better categorize applications. The middle bar shows all the results after filtering and provides overview and basic progresses for all the applications. On the right, this is the content section for further and detail information for each application. Users have freedom to show or hide anyone of the bar if they do not need it on the top bar. On the top right corner, there is a setting button for general app manipulation.</p>
