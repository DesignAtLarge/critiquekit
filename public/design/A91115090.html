<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My lead user Sharon Huang, a senior international student in UC San Diego, is eagerly seeking for jobs including internships, part-time jobs and full-time jobs to build up her experience. At the beginning, she met a large problem on managing them because here are so many applications that it is difficult for her to keep track of every step. Sometimes, she forgot when was the application open and end, when she needed to upload the resume or portfolio, when her interview started, and etc. In order to help herself to solve those problem, she writes down all the information into one notebook and categorizes them into sections.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently Sharon is applying for full-time jobs starting from fall 2017. Her task in the video is to keep track of applications for Google, Microsoft and Intuit and start a new application for Workday. After logins, she has a overview of her applications. By clicking the corresponding messages, she can go to the result page directly. However, because she does not remember what status of applications for Google, Microsoft and Intuit, she clicks the “Manage Applications” to see all the applications. After going to the detailed page for Google, she starts preparing the interview by writing notes. For Microsoft, she clicks the “Send Email” button in status column to directly send message to recruiter&nbsp;during waiting process to keep track of current status. Since the test time of Intuit is approaching, she clicks the “Practice Tests” button to go the Leetcode to prepare the coding test. Finally, she adds a new application by clicking the “add” button on the top right corner and enters the URL of Workday recruitment page. The system automatically extracts the information from the website and she can start preparing under the “Your Application” section on detailed page.</p>
