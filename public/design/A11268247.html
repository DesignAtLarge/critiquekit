<p><strong>Lead user:</strong></p>
<p>Angela is a college student who has late-night classes and club activities also keep her late at school. She walks home afterwards in the dark and so safety is always a concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>Right now, Angela carries pepper spray, sound grenade, and other products designed for women's safety. She has never been approached before or been in a dangerous situation but she is worried that if something does happen, she won't be able to respond in time. If she freezes in fear, she won't be able to defend herself,</p>
