<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>When it comes to skincare, a lot of people don't know how to approach it. For example, people often look up many videos or scrolling through endless&nbsp;forums for ways to clear up acne or other skin issues that they may be facing. The extent of most people's knowledge about skin blemishes is limited to acne but the reality is that there are different types of acne that would require different care. Sometimes people may have other skin issues that they did not know about or know how to approach it. Milia, for example, is another common skin problem people have but don't know about it or how to clear it from their skin. In order to find a solution to it, people often have to comb through various YouTube videos or beauty forums and make a list of possible products they can use. There is no easy way for people to categorize this information without using several platforms at once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The task here is to allow the user to easily identify skin issues that they may have by using the camera in their device. AR technology will create an overlay that identifies what skin issues they have and it also recommends products that are popular with other users with a similar skin problem so that the user can save and look over/compare the different products. The idea is to simplify the process of skincare so that users aren't intimidated by it; this is important since skin is the largest organ on the human body and it is important that we take good care of it.&nbsp;</p>
