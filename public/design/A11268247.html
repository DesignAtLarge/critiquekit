<p>My original lead/user domain focused on ensuring the user's safety while they walked home alone at night. One of the feedback comments I received inspired me to change my idea a little to an app that focused on ride sharing safety. One of my friends actually had had a negative experience with a late-night Uber driver who kept prying into her personal life and asking for details. The only thing she could do was keep her phone out in case she needed to call someone for help. Uber has also launched a safety feature in which the rider can share their route and ride with a friend or family member. But&nbsp;the app doesn't alert the emergency contact if something has gone wrong during the ride. Most people are not going to stare at their phone for 15-20 minutes and even if they do, they wouldn't know if the rider was feeling uncomfortable or in a situation where they cannot contact someone.</p></span>
