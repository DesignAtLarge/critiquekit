<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p><strong>Inspiration:</strong></p>
<p>My lead user is Tommy. He was a teacher at an elementary school whose classroom budget for Halloween activities was 20$. Since it was around Halloween, Tommy's classroom activities consisted of scary stories, scary face-paintings, pumpkin carvings, and Halloween themed cookies. Tommy looked up scary stories on the internet and spent all 20$ on the face-painting items, which meant he had no more money to spend.&nbsp;To solve for this low budget problem, he went to the local Safeway to ask for donations. Instead of asking for cash donations, he believed it would be more time efficient if they directly donated actual school supplies. The manager and employees at the Safeway couldn't donate exactly what&nbsp;Tommy wanted, but&nbsp;they were still able to donate mini-pumpkins and a batch of halloween themed cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p>My app focuses on helping low-budget classrooms/schools receive school supplies through donations from local stores or community members. The task is to request certain supplies to be donated to your school/class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Design:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The landing page is the user's classroom, his requests, request history, and donation history. Tapping on an item in "Requests" allows the user to edit the quantity and item being requested. The app also allows different teachers to choose their own classrooms to make their own requests for supplies. Ideally, this app would be on a tablet in the teacher's lounge or on an iPhone to make the interaction more personal. Users also have the opportunity to donate any extra supplies they may have to other schools/classrooms with low budgets.</p>
