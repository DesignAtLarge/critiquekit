<p><em>Tommy Thach</em> is an elementary school teacher at a school with a very low budget. He asked for donations from people and stores to solve this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario: </strong></p>
<p>The school that Tommy teaches at doesn't have sufficient funds for Tommy to create a fulfilling schedule for his students. For Halloween activities, Tommy's classroom budget is&nbsp;only $20, but the&nbsp;calculated total for his activities summed up to $78. He needs to find a way to obtain the necessary supplies to make sure his students have a good time in class. The app helps users find people/stores that are willing to donate school supplies to their classrooms.</p>

<p>Note: Was not able to film the lead user because he currently lives very far from SD. I conducted user research through a phone interview with him.&nbsp;</p></span>
