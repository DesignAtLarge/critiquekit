<span data-pats="text" class="actual_text post_region_text"><p>Lead User: Nicolle Woo, about to graduate from UCSD. She lives in a house with three of her friends. She loves to cook but often finds herself forgetting about groceries that she has bought or not realizing that they re about to expire. To help solve this problem she attaches her receipts to her fridge after highlighting items that will expire soon or that she does not purchase on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Nicolle is cooking dinner for herself. She has a plan all figured out for what she's going to make. Using Grocery Mate she sees that the mozarella cheese she purchased last week is about to expire. She realizes that it would be easy to incorporate it into the meal that she's cooking to help her use it up before it goes bad. Grocery Mate syncs with her purchases from grocery stores to gather information about everything she purchased there. With this information she is able to sort her groceries by expiration date to see what she needs to use right away, by category as a quick way to browse fridge contents, by the frequency at which an item is purchased to make sure an uncommon item doesn't get lost in the back and by price to see what her big ticket items are.&nbsp;</p>
