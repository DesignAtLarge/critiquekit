<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yard: Lisa wants to learn a new type of shoulder massage from her friend, so they gather around his "massage table" interface and he demonstrates this new technique, showing the hand movements and the pressure which should be applied when. All of his movements are recorded along with a few notes for her to practice with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foot: One of Lisa's friends has been complaining about a sore neck. She decides this is a good time to try out the new massage technique she has been practicing. She pulls out her iPad, selects the neck as the area to massage and then pulls up the specific type of massage she wants to do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inch: After selecting the massage that she wants to perform on her friend, the instructions now pop up on her glasses interface and she is able to see all of the movements she is supposed to perform projected onto her friends neck in real time.</p>
