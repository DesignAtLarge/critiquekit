My interface populates all of its data when a person goes shopping at a grocery store, all of the items they purchase and certain pieces of key information about them are stored in the database. This is then displayed on the fridge, allowing users to examine the contents of their fridge at a glance. What is unique about this design, however, is that it shows you more than can be seen from simply looking inside the fridge. Smaller items which may have been pushed to the back of the fridge and hidden behind something large are now readily available so they will not be forgotten about. A person can organize this list by expiration dates, the frequency or regularity at which an item is purchased and the price of an item. This inspiration was drawn from a lead user, Nicolle Woo, who attaches her receipts to the door of her fridge after highlighting items which she thinks she may forget about or that expire quickly.</p>
